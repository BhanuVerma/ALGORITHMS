'dc.py' contains the divide and conquer algorithm for the given problem and 'dp.py' contains the dynamic programming algorithm for the given problem.

Just navigate to the Assignment+3 directory and run both these files using following command:

'python dp.py' for running dynamic programming algorithm
'python dc.py' for running divide and conquer algorithm

Data loading and data writing has been taken care of by the python scripts and there is no extra work required. After running this command, you can see the terminal to view log statements and once python scripts finish running, you can view the generated output files in the output folder.
